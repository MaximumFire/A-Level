randomly choose from either center or one of the corners (decent starting positions)
run through main loop:
	check all empty squares to see if the opponent placing a symbol in one of them causes a win for them
	if one found:
		place symbol in that square
	else:
		check to see if you can win by placing a symbol in a square
		if you can:
			place one there
		else:
			place randomly
repeat that loop until a draw or case where the player is able to create two winning moves simultaneously, breaking my algorithm
