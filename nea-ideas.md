Possible project ideas so far:

- Machine Learning / Genetic Algorithm To Solve Problems

- N-Body Simulation





Genetic Algorithm:

- Simulate a survival of the fittest situation with animals?

- Most efficient way to solve a maze?

- Design a series of puzzles for it to solve?

- Implement generational learning?





N-Body Simulation:

- Simulate the chaotic nature of more than two bodies interacting with eachother.

- Display use of complex mathematical concepts to achieve this.
