Explanation of the Current Challenge

Despite the growing interest in chess, we have struggled to find a comprehensive and user-friendly website that meets the needs of our diverse membership. Existing platforms either lack the functionality we require or are too cumbersome for our members to use effectively. Most websites are designed with a general audience in mind and do not cater specifically to the unique needs of chess clubs and their members.
Current Solution

Currently, we use a combination of different tools to manage our operations:

    A basic WordPress site: For general information and news updates.
    Google Forms and Sheets: For membership registration and tracking.
    Emails and WhatsApp groups: For communication and coordination.
    Chess.com and Lichess: For online game hosting and competitions.

Desired Solution

We are looking for an integrated and cohesive web platform that consolidates all our activities and provides a seamless experience for our members. Specifically, we would like the new solution to:

    Comprehensive Membership Management: A robust system to handle member registrations, renewals, and payments.
    Event and Tournament Management: Tools to schedule, manage, and promote tournaments and club events, including automated pairings and results tracking.
    Online Play and Training: Integration with popular chess platforms like Chess.com or Lichess for hosting online games and training sessions.
    Content Management System (CMS): Easy-to-use CMS for posting news, articles, and updates about chess strategies, upcoming events, and member achievements.
    Community Features: Forums or discussion boards to foster community interaction, share tips, and discuss games.
    Mobile-Friendly: A responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices to ensure accessibility for all members.
    Notifications and Alerts: Automated email and SMS notifications for important updates, event reminders, and other announcements.
    Customizable User Profiles: Allow members to create and manage their profiles, track their game history, and display their achievements.
    Resource Library: A repository for educational content, such as tutorials, strategy guides, and recorded lectures from chess masters.

In summary, we need a tailored solution that not only addresses our current pain points but also enhances the overall experience for our members, making it easier for them to engage with the club and improve their chess skills.
