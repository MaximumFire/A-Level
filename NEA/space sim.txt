space sim:

rendering objects
constant time clock - check
	- 10tps
constant scale for the screen (how many pixels is a metre/how many metres is a pixel) - check
	- 940x500px = 9.4*10^7m x 5*10^7m
	- 100_000m = 1 pixels
	

performance improvements:
	- store forces as pure i,j components instead of having to find angles
